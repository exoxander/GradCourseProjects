The two folders contain slightly different versions of the program

"CLI and hardcoded graph" is similar to the submissions for past assignments, 
it runs my algorithm on a hard-coded test graph and allows program variables to be
input through the command line on the program call

"Interactive visualizer" uses the OLC Pixel Game Engine to run a visualization
of my algorithm operating on a graph, which can be randomized and re-run ant trials inside the program.
this does not take any command line inputs, however the control variables can still be found
and changed near the top of Simulation.cpp
